The locally stored CSL JSON file is available as [`references.json`](references.json).

The benefits of having bibliographic data in a knowledge base are best
illustrated by the [Scholia](https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/) frontend to
Wikidata: this website can be used to explore research publications and their
connections to authors, institutions, places and other enties [@Scholia].
