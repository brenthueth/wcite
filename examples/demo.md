  This document illustrates use of Wikidata as reference manager with

...

Wikidata is a community-curated knowledge based that covers and connects all
kinds of entities such as people, places, and publications [@Q18507561].  The
**WikiCite initiative**^[See <http://wikicite.org/> for additional links.]
promotes using Wikidata as universal bibliographic database.

The benefits of having bibliographic data in a knowledge base are best
illustrated by the *Scholia* frontend to Wikidata: this website can be used to
explore research publications and their connections to authors, institutions,
places and other enties [@Scholia].
